## 10/14/2025 10 AM - Set up the clock module  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

Made the clock module schematic following the schematic that Ben Eater made. It took me a little bit for me to figure out what RV1 was turns out it was a Potentiometer. I have also stared work on the a-register. I still need to figure out how to make it different from the one Ben Eater made so I'm not just copying his schematic and calling it my own. ![Screenshot_20251014_104442.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIwMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--0414950fb8ee1dacb4ae17ba9ccf1d42f8d0abc1/Screenshot_20251014_104442.png)  

## 10/14/2025 11 AM - layed out the schematic for the a-register and b-register  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

I got the a-register schematic layed out and all the connections set up. sense i just needed to grab the components and nothing was really hard to find it didn't take to hard to make. sense the b register is basically the same (the only difference is the output names) I just copied the existing schematic file and hierarchical sheet and edited it to make it work.

## 10/19/2025 - Made the scematic for the ALU and flags register  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

set up the flags register and the ALU schematic. it wasn't to hard to do but i did figure out how to make the schematic look better so it probably looks better then my previous schematics. I also figured out that there is a version control function built into KiCad though i may stick to the command line for the future.

## 10/21/2025 - Made the MAR module  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

I made the schematic for the MAR module witch was pretty easy as non of the parts needed swapped out. I didn't really learn any thing new in the process other then if you hold control you can move things off the grid.

## 10/22/2025 - Make a symbol for the 74189 ram chip  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

Sense i couldn't find a symbol or a alternative that works with out extensive upgrades to the rest of the computer i decided to make a symbol biased on data sheet linked to by Ben Eater.
I managed it by essentially copying the connection diagram from the data sheet and turning it into a symbol then using the block diagram to figure out the what pins where outputs.
I figgured out how to use the symbol editor and how to tell what pins are inputs and what pins are outputs.

## 10/25/2025 6 PM - Made the RAM module  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

I made the ram module for the PC. but sense i used a custom symbol for one of the chips i need it isn't as clean as i would have hoped but it works.
It was a little harder then the other modules because the custom symbols didn't match the pin names of the symbols on the reference schematic so i needed to make sure that i was matching the pin names and not the pin numbers.

## 10/25/2025 7 PM - Made the program counter  

_Time spent: 0.3h_  

I made the program counter witch is the easiest part of the entire project.
For this one the hardest part was just making it look nice witch didn't take to long and wasn't to hard.

## 10/26/2025 9 AM - Set up the output module  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

I got the sheet for the output module set up witch besides needing to find a replacement for the 28c16 EEPROM chip. that was its own adventure but digikey was helpful for finding one. i didn't find a full drop in replacement though i have now figured out the naming scheme for EEPROM families.
Over all it was fun to set up. though i do hope that i am using the same symbols becasue the symbols i am using are diffrent pin names then the same pins that the guide i am using has.

## 10/26/2025 2 PM - Set up the cpu control module  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I got the schematic for the control module set up. it wasn't very hard though i did need to wire one section of it twice because i did it wrong the first time. though i did take a little bit for me to get all of the sheet pins set up because there are 16 pins that are all different so i couldn't just copy and paste the parts that where the same.

![Screenshot_20251026_141857](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NTc3NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2be6deb95108e0b35235c309998a77805527b797/Screenshot_20251026_141857.png)
  

## 10/26/2025 4 PM - finnised makeing the schematics  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

I originally connected everything using busses and wires until i got to the end of my first wiring run at witch point i was using global labels to connect stuff. After i finished everything i realized that i may have messed stuff up because the way i set up the busses might not have worked at witch point i switched to using global labels for connecting over long distances.

## 10/27/2025 - Cleaned up schematic and added power input  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I did the (rough) calculations for power and figured out that a USB-C port with amperage set to 500 mA will be enough for the power. i also cleaned up the schematic and got the annotations and started getting footprints ready for the PCB design.![Screenshot_20251027_205614](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjEwMiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--23b4cb1bba18f4c2535f5c72a6ab516c2e4cc7fd/Screenshot_20251027_205614.png)
  

## 10/29/2025 - Organised and routed the PCB  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

I layed out the PCB and got freerouting started on routing the traces so i don't have to manually run nearly 1000 traces. though i have forgot to add the silkscreen to label what buttons and switches are for so i will need to run it again after i do that. though having the buttons and switch uses on a document that goes with the project could also work.
![Screenshot_20251029_214637](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjU5NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--188d15f6137761201e3e793af510f96dc11136d8/Screenshot_20251029_214637.png)
  

## 10/30/2025 - remaking the pcb layout  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

started reworking the pcb layout so i can run the traces manualy without spending a few weeks on it. still quite early but sense i have it set up in as modules it shoun't take me to long once i get each of the modules layed out so they connect together at least semi organised if not optimized.![Screenshot_20251030_215059](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njg5NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ebf045ece5c1c88076987347b2fc98b2b53547eb/Screenshot_20251030_215059.png)
  

## 11/3/2025 - cleaned up to pcb and started fixing some of the ERC errors  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

Didn't really get to much done but i now have the PCB mostly layed out and just need to get the traces routed after fixing the ERC errors i have. I have figured out how to get only certain nets to show at a time.
![Screenshot_20251103_212619](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODI0NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--2887388454adc659ec7508ebe83aa6af96c272d1/Screenshot_20251103_212619.png)
  

## 11/4/2025 - Fixed all but one of the ERC errors.  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

I fixed most of the ERC errors witch i probably should have done before i spent a while on the pcb layout but hindsight is 2020. Though it does seem that most of the errors i had where from unconnected pins so they weren't hard to fix.
attached is a screen shot of the last ERC error i have remaining.![Screenshot_20251104_200049](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODQ3MSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7f557a745c9d07c693dc7781734143d2308d65d8/Screenshot_20251104_200049.png)
  

## 11/6/2025 11 AM - Routed the gnd plane  

_Time spent: 3.0h_  

sense i did the cost/benefit analysis and found that a 6 layer PCB is worth the extra cost over a 2 layer PCB and sense with the $20 coupon it is actually cheaper then the 4 layer PCB ($3 less but still) i chose to go with a 6 layer pcb to make routing easier. Now i have all of the ground pins routed with only 7 traces that needed to change to the top layer for the 555 timers and 2 other of the same ICs and the USB-C port because they are SMD (i couldn't find any THT footprints for them). next i am going to do the power plane.![Screenshot_20251106_105905](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODkxOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--4fb9a827adad0aa0231277a64f1824bf8fa5b2b3/Screenshot_20251106_105905.png)
  

## 11/6/2025 7 PM - Routed the power plane  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

Routed the power plane of the PCB and like the ground plane it just had a few SMD pins to route.
this was pretty simple because i had figured out how to do it properly already.![Screenshot_20251106_193525](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTA0MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--dad986a8453e4f22dbae03b727cd1d89e254cf7d/Screenshot_20251106_193525.png)
  

## 11/6/2025 9 PM - finished routing the PCB  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

Sense i chose to go with the 6 layer PCB the routing of the signals was easy. the hardest part was trying to find the nets that still needed connected near the end and figuring out the via setup for the areas that need a high amount of level changes in a concentrated areas though i did try to avoid that completely.
now the question is what silkscreen art to add to the blank spaces.
![Screenshot_20251106_212630](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTA2NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6028450f60c72b311cb83152893c8ca4ebd27323/Screenshot_20251106_212630.png)  

## 11/7/2025 2 PM - made the case and added the silkscreen art  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

made a simple case for my project witch is more for keeping the solder joints and the parts on the back off the ground so it is only a base with standoffs and doesn't include a top case. the silk screen art is just QR codes linking to the blueprint page and the github repo.![Screenshot_20251107_135502](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTIyMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--8f1208b1b9d7af18dfe3293b1833219e25e6e639/Screenshot_20251107_135502.png)

## 11/7/2025 8 PM - Rerouted the pcb  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

While i was working on the BOM for my project i realized that one of the parts i had on my PCB wasn't going to work so i needed to switch to a different chip that is a THT instead witch was also bigger. though sense i didn't really make to many changes to the layout re routing the PCB didn't take to long because i already know how it would work mostly. as long with using a ground and power plane instead of needing to connect via traces witch probably where to small to contain the power and heat anyways.![Screenshot_20251107_200941](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTI4MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--59641ff504840167d7b455b1fa445cc6c9f0cdad/Screenshot_20251107_200941.png)
  

## 11/9/2025 - Update BOM  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

Updated BOM to use parts sourced from LCSC. if a part was cheaper on Digikey or Jameco i left it to be ordered from there. I also removed the stencil from my order. i would switch to lead free HASL but JLCPCB doesn't let me choose anything but ENIG for a 6 layer PCB witch with the $20 coupon i am going to use (exspires 04/01/2026) it is $3 cheaper then a 4 layer PCB.

## 11/10/2025 - Fix some issues  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

Updated the readme to have a Screen shot of the PCB in the case (CAD models). Also i updated the BOM to included estimated shipping cost and Tariffs as well as other fees.
![Screenshot_20251110_180928](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTAyNDQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--faed8362a0d5aecec2a035b5dad741282cefe2da/Screenshot_20251110_180928.png)  

## 11/12/2025 - fixed the BOM and did a sanity check on the schematic  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

I went through my BOM again to make sure it was optimized. switched over a few items to LCSC so they where cheaper. also did a sanity check on the schematic to make sure that i didn't make any mistakes on it. asked for another set of eyes to check it over to make sure i didn't miss anything before i route the PCB again.
![Screenshot_20251112_120238](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTA2NDQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f6cf337264ec8a610aeccbbb143d102eb7ebfdc8/Screenshot_20251112_120238.png)
  

## 11/18/2025 12 PM - Added decupling capaciters  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

i added decoupling capacitors at 0.1µF to each IC. the longest part was figuring out how to place the caps to get them to function properly. After placing them on the PCB i rerouted it to make sure that it didn't cause any overlaps with existing traces and because i needed to move some of the ICs to make it work. Updated BOM to include number of new caps. BOM allready takes into account the $20 coupon for the 6 layer PCB.
![Screenshot_20251118_120720](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIyMTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--18799eafb359d0e6dfcbad325f5246ddd2417ef6/Screenshot_20251118_120720.png)
  

## 11/18/2025 5 PM - Finished updating BOM  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

I had started updating the BOM 5 hours ago but didn't update all of the amounts to match the order amount needed for my project because not all of the parts i could find at the cheapest allowed me to order the exact amount that i need for my project.![Screenshot_20251118_172353](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTIzMTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c1f5edc5d05398aa2cf23188947ff0a52aec8fd3/Screenshot_20251118_172353.png)
  

## 11/20/2025 - Laying out the PCB again  

_Time spent: 1.2h_  

biased of off some responses to a Red
dit thread asking for a review of my PCB. i decided that after i did some edits to my schematic witch was mostly just making the signals all flow left to right and having all the VCC labels point up and GND labels point down. I decided that completely redoing the PCB layout would be easiest to fix some of the issues/taking some of the advice for the layout. for anyone wondering here is the Reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/PrintedCircuitBoard/comments/1p0x2xf/review_request_8bit_pc/

## 11/30/2025 - Continued laying out the PCB  

_Time spent: 6.0h_  

Continued laying out the PCB. Currently just have the LEDs connected to the resisters and a couple of the busses connected to all of the pins they connect to.![Screenshot_20251130_184436](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTY2MDIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--5482966242a7385b54bd78eb3f0720ebfcc82509/Screenshot_20251130_184436.png)
  

## 12/1/2025 - Contine routing the PCB  

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

Continued routing the PCB. I think this is going to take at least on or two more journals to finish. I have managed to get down to two areas left to route though so probably just one more journal.
![Screenshot_20251201_211644](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTcwNzIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--964671f4744598bcdea8f246561a9d82815eabcc/Screenshot_20251201_211644.png)
  

## 12/3/2025 - Finnished routing the PCB  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

I finally finished routing the PCB again after redoing the layout to make more sense for the user. i know its a mess but as long as it works I'm fine with it.

## 12/8/2025 - tried to get reviews   

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

I spent a while (most of it was just waiting for any response so i didn't count it) trying to get any reviews for the pcb and schematic but could only get a total of one high quality review plus a few others that might not be as high quality. but all of that was from here https://www.reddit.com/r/PrintedCircuitBoard/comments/1p0x2xf/review_request_8bit_pc/
. i also tried asking in the KiCad discord server and in the voidstar lab discord server. i will link the thread for both so they are here in case i forget to add an update here. voidstar lab: https://discord.com/channels/771523295387582514/789303214016561173/1446703681511620780

## 12/10/2025 - Did a few things  

_Time spent: 4.0h_  

i updated the BOM to match current prices for all the parts and looked for cheaper parts. i also redesigned the case because i forgot to do that earlier. sense i haven't wanted to take the time to learn how to use onshape or FreeCAD i just made the case in tinkerCAD using basic shapes. I had to split the case in two with each half being the same part just rotated 180 degrees.![Screenshot_20251210_205432](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjIzMzcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--bee6be57d2e7d7c7341c5e9f865efe1d8e9b74b1/Screenshot_20251210_205432.png)
  

## 12/12/2025 8 AM - added schematic images to readme  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

Added images of the schematic to my readme. i didn't add them earlier because it wasn't required in the docs for a custom project and so i wouldn't have to add 11 more images to the readme.![Screenshot_20251212_082256](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjI5NjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--0e3566271fb30304cf200f5d09fb274ddbfe4e33/Screenshot_20251212_082256.png)
  

## 12/12/2025 3 PM - not sure what to put here  

_Time spent: 0.1h_  

This is just so i can add some clarification that i didn't think was necessary. I can't not use ENIG for my PCB because JLCPCB requires it on 6+ layer boards so the inside layers can get adequately cooled. I am only willing to switch to a 4 layer board if i can use an auto router and if it is the only reason i cant get the grant.

## 12/30/2025 - started soldering  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

I soldered the first 6 ics it took a while because at first i couldn't find my soldering kit and my dad's iron didnt want to work properly. Then when i found my kit (exactly where i put it) it took me a bit to remember how to solder properly which my dad helped me with.
