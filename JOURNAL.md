## 11/9/2025 - Setup the basics for the keyboard schematic  

I got the basics set up. so i have all 108 switches (subject to change) layed out and connected to the Pico. i have gotten most of the way on setting up the IO exstention board i just need to figure out where the ground pin on the symbol is and it is finished. i also have the models for all the symbols but the diodes assigned. i am going with a hybrid hot swap base so i can swap between MX Kalih and Choc switches with out much hassle.
