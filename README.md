# full-keyboard
This is a 108 key keyboard that follows the ansi 104 key layout with 4 extra keys above the numpad. It has spots for two rotary encoders and a oled but to start i am going to not include those to reduce cost.

I wanted to make this to allow me to try a mechanical keyboard without needing to spend $200+ for a lowend mechanical keyboard and to give a chance to use QMK firmware.

To make this keyboard for your self upload the gerbers in [/PCB](/PCB) to your prefered pcb site. case is designed to be 3d printed both sides are the same part so just print the 3d model in [/CAD](/CAD) twice then rotate to fit. firmware is built like any qmk firmware. instructions are in the folder as well. other parts are listed below and in BOM.csv
